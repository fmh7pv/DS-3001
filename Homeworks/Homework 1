## Are there differences in the number of succesful attempts of a homekick based on ydline and quarter?

## Pseudocode 
  - Group by Quarter
  - Calculate Yardline Average
  - Count total Homekicks
  - Calculate % Succesful homekick 
  - Arrange in descending order by ydline
Loading and preparing the data 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
sports <- read.csv("nfl2008_fga.csv")

names <- c("homekick","qtr")

sports[,names] <- lapply(sports[,names],factor)

str(sports)
```

Single line version 
```{r}
View(sports)
x1 <- group_by(sports,qtr)

View(x1)
x2 <- summarize(x1,homekick=sum(homekick == 1),count=n(), mean(ydline))

View(x2)
x2$ave_homekick <- x2$homekick/x2$count

x2

x3 <- arrange(x2,desc(`mean(ydline)`))
print(x3)
```

## Piping it all together. 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
#creating a dplyr version
(admit_1 <- group_by(sports, qtr)%>%
 summarize(homekick=sum(homekick == 1),count=n(),mean(ydline))%>%
 mutate(ave_homekick=homekick/count)%>%
 arrange((`qtr`)))
```
## Function  
```{r}
ave_homekick <- function(x){
  xx <- group_by(x, qtr)%>% 
 summarize(homekick=sum(homekick == 1),count=n(),mean(ydline))%>%
  mutate(ave_homekick=homekick/count)%>%  
  arrange(desc(`mean(ydline)`))
  print(xx)
}

```

```{r}
ave_homekick(sports)

#What do about these results are interesting? 

#The quarter with the most succesful homekicks is quarter 5.
#The smallest mean ydline is the least successful with homekicks which is suprising to me! I assumed that the closer you are to the goal post the better chance of successful attempt. 

```


## Are the similarities between the number of wines that get an 8 by alcohol and citric acid 

## Pseudocode 
  - Select alcohol and citric acid 
  - Arrange by descending 
  - Group by Quality 
  - Arrange in descending order by Citric Acid 
  
Loading and preparing the data 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
wine <- read.csv("winequality-red.csv")
wine$quality <- as.factor(wine$quality)
str(wine)
```
Single line version 
```{r}
View(wine)
x1 <- select(wine, alcohol, citric.acid, quality) 
View(x1)
x2 <- arrange(x1, desc(quality))
view(x2)
x3 <- group_by(x2, quality)
view(x3)
x4 <- summarize(x3,citric.acid=sum(citric.acid),count=n(),mean(alcohol))
view(x4)

```

```{r}
ave_citric.acid <- function(x){
  xx <- select(wine, alcohol, citric.acid, quality) %>% 
  filter(quality ==8)%>% 
  arrange(desc(citric.acid))%>% 
  print(xx)
}
```

```{r}
ave_citric.acid(wine)

#The alcohol content is really high in the wine scored an 8. Also the citric acid is really high, which makes sense as citric acid as a "fresh" taste to the wine. 
```
