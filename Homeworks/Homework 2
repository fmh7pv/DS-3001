### What Do I Think?
I think this article gives really good and practical examples as how companies and people can utilize data science in their careers. Its cool seeing this once man to machine effort in so many industries. I never knew data science could apply to a vast majority of fields. As someone studying this I do have a better understanding of why and in what ways these different industries now need data scientist.
